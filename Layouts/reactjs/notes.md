## Things to talk about

* Prefer specifying a class name instead of using > syntax
* Keep running tabs on different resolutions, use @media to specify targeted resolutions, check all for updates(if on there was a way to do that conveniently ðŸ˜œ)
* attribute selector syntax is interesting, leans more towards an element functionality based naming style. Possibly interesting ability to set style inheritance hierarchy. Not implicit that it impacts styling, though.
* Interesting use of before, not sure about full value, since element was not reused(perk of using before)
* Failed on implementing main-content background image ðŸ˜Ÿ
